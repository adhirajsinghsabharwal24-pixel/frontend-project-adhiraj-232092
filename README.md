- Hero with animated typewriter slogans  
- Live captions (Web Speech API) — optional, works best in Chrome/Edge  
- Product grid with quick-view modal  
- **Persistent cart** saved to localStorage  
- Add/remove items, quantity updates, subtotal/tax/shipping calculation  
- Gallery, About, Testimonials, Contact sections  
- Performance-optimized (lazy loading, reduced reflows, optimized images)

## Files

## Notes for the grader
- Images use Unsplash placeholders — can be replaced with custom images.
- Live captions require microphone permission and work best on desktop Chrome.
- The checkout process is a UI mock (no backend).

## Performance improvements
- Lazy-loaded product images  
- Reduced image sizes  
- Batching DOM updates  
- Minimized heavy CSS  
- Throttled animations and event listeners
